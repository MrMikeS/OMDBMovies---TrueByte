# OMDBMovies---TrueByte

This is a C# MVC .Net6 Single Page Application to Search Movies from the OMDB web api. You can search for a movie by Title/Name, Year of Release and Type(eg movie or series). The results are displayed in a grid format. To reset your search click the main welcome header.
If I had more time to continue the development of this application. I would of added more search parametres. I would have also included Authentication and Authorisation for the users. Allowing them to log in and rate and comment on each movie and also to create a user profile.
